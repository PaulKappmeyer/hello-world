First Test Tutorial Repository

This is my first Github Project. I am following the Tutorial, but i will do my own Projects later on.
Github is really usefull, because for example i am tired of making projects like: Test1, Test1 changes, Test2 and so on.
Github helps to have the whole history of our Project at one place and you dont need to care about changes, because you can go back to your branch, which was working quiet well
